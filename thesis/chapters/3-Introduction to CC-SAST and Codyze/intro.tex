\chapter{Introduction to \cognicryptsast{} and \codyze}
\label{ch:intro}
In this chapter, we will discuss \cognicryptsast{} and \codyze{} in greater detail to gain a better understanding of the tools and their capabilities. In addition, this information can be utilized to compare the tools in Chapter \ref{ch:compare} and to evaluate their performance in Chapter \ref{ch:eval}.

Here we have described how \cognicryptsast{} and \codyze{} perform the analysis, the components they use to accomplish it, and the properties of their analysis. Having an understanding of \codyze{} and \cognicryptsast, we can now begin to compare them. In the following chapter, we will provide a comparison of these tools.
