# Thesis-2021-Asgharivaskasi
This repository contains the translated rules from MARK to CrySL and vice versa, as a part of the Master thesis of comparison of [Codyze](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/codyze) and [CogniCrypt-SAST](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis). The origianl MARK rules written by MARK mainatiners are available in [this](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/codyze/tree/main/src/dist/mark) link and the original CrySL rules developed by CrySL developers are available at [this](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/Crypto-API-Rules) link.

There are three sets of translated rules that include: 
1. Translation of CrySL ruleset for the JCA API till commit [72d7978](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/Crypto-API-Rules/tree/master/JavaCryptographicArchitecture) to MARK.
2. Translation of CrySL ruleset for the Bouncy Castle JCA API till commit [443cca5](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/Crypto-API-Rules/tree/master/BouncyCastle-JCA) to MARK.
3. Translation of MARK ruleset for the Bouncy Castle API till commit [8c74a13](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/codyze/tree/main/src/dist/mark/bouncycastle) to Crysl.

There is also a pdf of BSI TR-02102-1 guideline version 2019-01 that the original MARK rules are written based on it.
